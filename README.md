# Requirement
- Fork this repository and complete your work. Use **github** to track your progress.
- Provide PHP examples of creational patterns as much as you can. Everything is up to you, I appreciate that if you do more than one pattern ;). I'd like to suggest you should start with Singleton, Factory Method and Builder patterns.
- You have one week for this challenge.
- Use PHPUnit or PHPSpec for unit testing.

Good luck!
